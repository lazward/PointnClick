# Prototype 1 Project
Playable at: https://lazward.github.io/PointnClick/

In this game, you're given a limited amount of time to sort red and blue colored balls into the right areas. If you mess up or if the timer runs out the game ends.
This project utilizes many elements learned from ApplePicker. These include aspects like the orthographic camera (which is facing downwards here), score and high score, object lists, loading scenes and more.
Features learned from Roll-a-ball and MissionDemolition are also utilized here, for the purpose of fulfilling my goal of applying what I've learned to put together this project.
